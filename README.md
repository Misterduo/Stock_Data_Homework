# Stock_Data_Homework

Please use "stock_data.py" located in "venv" to run the programm and create a column, with calculated percentage change between Close and Open price. 
In "csv files for edit" are the files that will be edited by the code - if you want, check them before and after the code has run. 
In "extra files unedited for checking" are same files, that won't be effected by code - use it as a backup to double check it.
Thank you!
